# Event Driven Archtecture using Red Panda and Materialize.


The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate the integration between Red Panda and Materialize for an event driven architecture.

## Main reasons for this architecture

* Wanted to test both tools as they are gathering lots of attention
* Use of Python instead of Java or Scala but still having high performance
	* Red Panda is implemented in C++
	* Full compatibility with Kafka APIs
	* Easier to use for analytics roles
	* Materialize is implemented in Rust
	* Materialize uses SQL but queries can be executed from Python
